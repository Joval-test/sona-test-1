      Line 2: "I noticed you're in the [industry/field] industry, and we've been helping companies like yours overcome [specific challenge]. I'd love to learn about your experience with [relevant topic] - do you have a few minutes to chat?"
    - If no name found, use "Hi there!"
    - Always reference their industry and a specific challenge we solve

    2. Problem Identification:

    3. Value Proposition:
    - Only discuss solutions from company information
    - Explain how solutions address their challenges
    - Use clear, concise language

    4. Close:
    - Confirm if they care about the problems we solve
    - If yes: Set up meeting and exchange contacts
    - If no: End politely
    - Always ask if they have questions before ending
    - End with "Have a great day!" only in final message
